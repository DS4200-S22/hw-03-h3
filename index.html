                The data type used for this chart are 'items' and 'attributes'. The 'items' are the individual data point that composes each bar. 
                Each data point has two categorical attributes(define the x-axis and colors) and one quantitative attribute(defines the y-axis). The marks used for this
                chart are 'lines', and they are used as 'items/nodes' to represent each bar. The channels used for this graph are 'position'(vertical and horizontal positions) and 'color'.

                The data type used for this chart are 'items', 'attributes', and 'links'. The 'items' are the individual node.
                Seemingly, each node has a categorical attribute to identify its class(IDEA, THEME, CATEGORY).
                It might have a quantitative attribute that contributes to the intensity of each node's color. 
                It also has another categorical attribute for indicating its relationship with other nodes. 
                The marks used for this chart are 'lines' and 'points'. The marks are used as "items/nodes" and 'links'.
                The 'lines' are used to indicate the relationship between two nodes. The 'points' are used to represent the nodes. 
                The channel used for this chart is 'color'.

                The data type used for this chart are 'items' and 'attributes'. The 'item' are the individual node.
                Each node has a categorical attribute to identify its class(A, B, C, D) and another ordinal attribute
                to indicate its rank. It also has a quantitative attribute to indicate the timestamp. The marks used for
                this chart are 'lines' and 'points'. The marks are used as 'items/nodes' and 'links'. The 'points' are used
                to represent the nodes. The lines are used to group the nodes. The channels used are 
                'positions'(vertical and horizontal positions) and 'colors'.

                this chart are 'points' and 'areas'. The marks are used as 'items/nodes'. The 'points' are used to represent
                the bubbles. The 'areas' are to used to partition each bubble into multiple portions. The channels used for this
                chart are 'position'(vertical and horizontal positions)), 'color', and 'area'(size of the bubble).
